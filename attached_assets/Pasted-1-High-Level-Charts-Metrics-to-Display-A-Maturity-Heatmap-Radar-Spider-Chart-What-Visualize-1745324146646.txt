1. High-Level Charts & Metrics to Display
A. Maturity Heatmap (Radar/Spider Chart)
What: Visualize maturity scores across all main dimensions in a single, color-coded chart.

Why: Instantly highlights strengths and weaknesses across the eight domains for executive review.

B. Dimension Progress Over Time (Line/Bar Chart)
What: Track maturity improvements (or declines) per dimension/metric across assessment periods.

Why: Shows impact of interventions and guides where to focus next.

C. Comparative Benchmarking (Bar Chart/Table)
What: Compare current scores to industry standards, peer organizations, or benchmarks.

Why: Motivates improvement and contextualizes current state.

D. Priority/Gap Analysis (Bubble or Quadrant Chart)
What: Plot each metric by “importance” vs. “current maturity” to spotlight critical improvement areas.

Why: Directs attention and resources for maximum impact.

E. Distribution of Maturity Levels (Stacked Bar or Pie Chart)
What: Show percentage of metrics at each maturity level (e.g., Initial, Developing, Defined, Managed, Optimized).

Why: Easy snapshot of overall organizational maturity.
